# etch-a-sketch

The Etch-A-Sketch project is part of the Odin Project curriculum.

This project highlighted for me the importance of planning before coding a solution as the code quickly became messy. Whilst I have cleaned it up a little it is still probably not pleasant to look at and needs some refactoring work done.

In the future I may implement:

- Options for custom colors
- Eraser tool
- Better looking UI and layout
